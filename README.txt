Open Street Maps - Nearest Bus Stops

Overview
This project integrates CTA bus stop data with Northwestern Universityâ€™s Evanston campus Open Street Maps, 
allowing users to locate the nearest southbound and northbound bus stops for a selected building. 
The program also fetches real-time bus arrival predictions using the CTA Bus Tracker API.

Features
- Building Location Calculation: Calculates the latitude and longitude of a building based on its perimeter nodes.
- Bus Stop Integration: Reads bus stop data from a CSV file and organizes it into a structured format.
- Closest Bus Stops: Identifies the nearest northbound and southbound bus stops for a given building.
- Real-time Bus Predictions: Queries the CTA Bus Tracker API to fetch bus arrival times.
- Exception Handling: Ensures robust error management during API queries and data processing.

Input Format
- Enter a building name to find its closest bus stops.
- Use * to list all buildings or @ to list all bus stops.

Dependencies
- C++17 or later.
- CURL library for API communication.
- nlohmann/json library for JSON parsing.

Testing
- Test with real-time data using an API key.
- Test offline using provided mock data files in the /mock directory.

Example Output
Enter building name (* to list, @ for stops): University Library
Closest southbound stop: Sheridan & Foster (0.2 miles)
Closest northbound stop: Sheridan & Emerson (0.3 miles)
Bus Predictions:
  Vehicle #2092, Route #20, Direction: Westbound, ETA: 8 minutes
  Vehicle #2103, Route #20, Direction: Westbound, ETA: 12 minutes
